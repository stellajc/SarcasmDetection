She didn't then proceed to delete those emails after a subpeona. She didn't be so ruthless that her closest aid had a folder called 'life insurance' with a copy of the emails in case hillary ever turned on her.

1	Right, because you want to make a grand strategy in a complete vacuum with no idea what is going on.	mindlessrabble	politics	7	-1	-1	2016-11	1480287792	"Not to disregard intelligence briefings but there is a point to be made for ignoring them when making what I call ""grand strategy"" or realpolitik based decisions, as a supreme leader of a country should. Intelligence briefings can confuse a person. They can overcomplicate a situation and blur the original picture of what you are trying to achieve. They can even prevent new ideas from emerging. I think intelligence briefings should be used like news you are reading daily: You should be aware of things happening, but you shouldn't focus on it too much otherwise you will lose the plot. Personally I feel better about a POTUS who uses his analytical abilities, rather than be swayed by a large amount of data, to drive policy. Keep in mind also that many of these intelligence advisers have agendas of their own and confirmation bias. They will repeat thesis to confirm their own beliefs. It's a little bit like in the old days with the advisers of the king. The point is...Keep them at arm's length but do not over-rely on them. This is not what strategy is about for anything (ruling a country or a company as a CEO)."

It feels like something like this came up earlier this year, something involving Ernie Sanders? Bernie Sanders? Yeah, that was it, now its coming back to me. Didn't a large number of the Clinton supporters and the establishment media spend a bunch of time explaining why exit polls are worthless in the U.S., cant be used in the same manner as they are used in the rest of the world and that such variations mean absolutely nothing at all? That such variations warranted absolutely no investigation or further focus? Nah, that cant be right, because that would make the current outcry by Clinton supporters and the establishment media completely and totally hypocritical. I mean when we saw the same thing happen during the Primaries to Bernie Sanders in certain states there was no need to recount or audit, wasnt even given a second thought. So whats changed between then and now that makes exit polling more accurate than it was earlier this year?

Either Russia, Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia, the military, or Oswald killed him alone. All these books, and at the minimum, all but one were complete bullshit. That is what these conspiracy theory fans dont get. Several of these JFK books seemed quite persuasive. But they were almost all of course wrong. They slapped facts together, made a case, and in the end it was crap. Conspiracies do exist of course, but human nature is such that the larger the conspiracy, the more it will fail. Think about our top secret info. Chelsea Manning a soldier leaks, Edward Snowden a civilian contractor leaks, Gen Petraeus leaks into his mistress and also hands her stuff. Some conspiracies like pedophile rings in England and the Catholic Church were covered up way too long. But it comes out.

But hearing his words and tone, you'd think we are literally one quarter away from declaring bankruptcy and food rationing."

It's not about being unable to vet them because there are too many or the system isn't thorough enough, it's about being unable to vet them because *they haven't done anything wrong*.

0	They're changing rooms, not stay fully clothed rooms.	OlimarsOnion	politics	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1478188830	"The only part of that advertisement I think is a little questionable is connecting the ""walking into changing rooms full of 15-year-old girls"" immediately with his comments about them having no clothes on - pretty sure he was referring to adult pageant contestants in that interview. It's a minor detail, but if my recollection is correct, it implies something that didn't happen. That said, it's a pretty powerful message that should resonate with women *and* men, and definitely with parents who want their children to grow up with positive role models."

1	But, e-mails and Hillary!	ShyBiDude89	politics	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1479148856	This is why the politicization of the SCOTUS was the WORST PART of this election. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY was talking about SCOTUS appointments when we were electing Obama or when Romney was running. But suddenly now it's a huge fucking deal? Love them or hate them, the SCOTUS operates best politically neutral. The fact we had a Supreme Court Justice weigh in on a presidential election is *unprecedented*, worse still that the Clinton camp was screaming themselves hoarse that Trump would have sway over appointing 4-8 justices (when in fact he'll maybe get to appoint 2). It was stupid to politicize the court and might very well end judicial independence in this country.

It is important to protect people from themselves -- this woman, and tens of millions of other people, are proof of that. Voting should be a licensed privilege to people who can pass a rather rigorous exam regarding the political system and how it works, understanding of economics and finance (and math), and an ethics portion. The average person shouldn't be able to pass this test. I don't want an average person making decisions anymore. Average people are just too stupid.

This was not done with the 22, 18, 16, or the Abrams, for some common examples. Will their predictions be accurate? Who knows, but putting a number, any number really, in the budget for the maintenance and the like for the entire lifetime of the platform is probably better than saying 'well this is what it cost us (taxpayers) to maintain our aging fleet this year, surprise!'. The failures in R&amp;D and initial trials are exactly why we have an R&amp;D phase and trial phase in testing new weapons platforms before fielding them in theater.

0	77% of all jobs that america lost in 2015 where to automation and only 23% where to outsourcing but i have yet to hear a political agenda that will prepare Americans for a post-industrial economy.	UltraRunningKid	politics	13	-1	-1	2016-12	1481039161	Its both though. First though - business isn't economics, the job of a business is to make money for its shareholders. It is the job of governments to look out for the economy and the collection of businesses. But US unemployment is now quite low, and mexico is still relatively poor. So laying off americans who can get othet jobs ( on average) to employ mexicans who can't is a reasonable economic choice. In the long run mexico will become a better consumer of stuff (as they have for several years) which makes for more customers. The US economy which is doing reasonably well will continue to comsume stuff at a reasonable pace. Such is the last 2 centuries of trade where automation destroyed something like 50-70% of all jobs, which were in agriculture.

I genuinely hope the GOP does something that improves care, reduces costs, and improved access to care. If they fail like you hope they do, people will suffer and surely many will die due to lack of care, or to not having anything but emergency care when it's likely already too late.

It will have to go through the House and Senate in which Republicans hold the majority 2. If he is impeached we get Pence, and when you combine the fact that he has administrative competence with his support of regressive social policies, he is arguably more dangerous.

They called Reagan an unhinged, madman racist who will plunge is into nuclear WW3 too and yet we're still here. In 2008 conservatives were screaming that Obama would ban guns and some were screaming he'd institute martial law. And yet we're still here. The point of a protest vote or voting 3rd party is to tell a party that they have lost you as a voter. These votes are one of the few checks we have to keep these parties in check anymore. I personally couldnt bring myself to vote for Obama or Romney in 2012. Obama had lost me after I was a rabid fan of him in 2008. Didn't deliver on the hope and change he promised. Romney, well, let's just say milquetoast Republicans aren't exactly inspiring. So, being happy with neither of them I voted for Mickey Mouse and despite being told by both Obama and Romney voters not voting for one or the other was a threat to our future, life went on pretty much the same as it ever had. If you don't want to give someone your vote, then don't do it. One thing I will never tell someone to do is tell them they have to vote for a particular candidate. I will say who I am voting for and why, but I will never tell them how they should vote because that is their choice and I can't make it for them."

The extreme right-wing have been attacking them since 1991. And in all that time, all those tens of millions of dollars spent on all those repeated investigations and the best they could come up with, in 25 years, was a BJ in the Oval Office. Lying about a consensual BJ was the only thing, in all that time, that they could make stick. Bill got impeached but kept his job as president. Nothing happened to Hillary. Monica has had many good, productive jobs. Google her, look at Wikipedia. Newt Gingrich lost his job as speaker of the house. When you think of all the people the Clintons have worked with over the years, people who are supposidly covering for them? You want to know what the chances are of all those people keeping these secrets and not taking for all those years are? Just look at what's happening to Trump, right now. People saw him doing these things, witnesses telling all. All his lies are coming back to bite him in the ass. So either all the accusations are just more of the lies that the extreme right-wing talk radio people have been telling about any successful Democrat, or we have yet another thing that Hillary can do that The Donald can't.

It easily added weeks to the project when I literally could've walked 100ft to the local CAD dept to get it right the first time, but allegedly it cost too much. Also, I would've been fired had I done that.

Why are we still discussing the popular vote? We have the electoral college for a certain reason. Just because more people live in California doesn't give California the right to elect the president of the united states. There are 50 states in the US. 50. There is only one California. Donald Trump won 30 states. Hillary Clinton won 20 states. We are a republic of states. So why exactly should 20 states tell 30 states what the fuck to do? That's why we have states rights. Because we are different and want different things. People in California want different things than in Oklahoma. But if you want to win the President of the United States. You need to make some effort and winning some voters in different states. Don't hate how the game is played. Just get better at the game. Don't blame the electoral college for Hillary Clinton's failure at appealing to voters. The electoral college has worked the same way whether a republican or democrat is in office.

Reagan was doing bailouts before they were cool. It's also worth noting that during the Inslaw affair, his AGs, first Edwin Meese, then Dick Thornburgh, both Republican, incidentally, refused to investigate, as did William P. Barr (R) under Bush.

How does he know this? It seems like he's either in possession of information about a credible threat or he's sending messages to his supporters to ensure the same.

My Aunt worked with him for the past decade and said he is an extremely hard worker and one of the most genuine people she knows. She really respects him and even though, she initially wasn't going to vote for Trump (she preferred Rubio), she said that everyone got along with him and he was very personal. His extremely wealthy friends (if they can be considered friends) are acting in self-interest. That's it. They don't agree with his policies and are trying to use their influence (if they have any) to convince people to vote against Trump. His policies will hurt them financially, and since they're not super close, they're trying to fuck him over. It's pretty obvious

I do not choose to be motivated by fearful threats to peoples' taught values. I simply understand that others may feel very afraid because of what they were taught to value. I too want to be an understanding person.

Elmattador	politics	1	-1	-1	2016-11	1479219732	Here's the deal with Glenn Beck - he goes where the money is and, in politics, the money is where the opposition is. Think about it: When Bush was in office, MSNBC hit it big with Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow. They would fact check Bush on the daily, criticize his war efforts, and beef up Obama. Glenn b From 2009-2016, Fox reigned across all anti-Obama coverage. Back during the Bush years, Beck was on CNN and was anti bush. As the race picked up steam for Obama against McCain, he became anti Obama. He then transitioned to Fox where he was vehemently anti-Obama for ages. Then he got fired and was totally anti-Obama until... now when he's Anti-Trump. So think about it. Beck is anti-CurrentPresident and runs his shows across different networks battling the current President. This results in ratings, in money, and in popularity. Fuck that guy.

0	Jeb would never have brought up Bills infidelity, he's not a loathsome dick.	thirdaccountname	politics	54	-1	-1	2016-10	1476300533	I think they would have won with Jeb!. If Hillary attacked W then attacking all of Bills scandals becomes completely fair game. Right now every time Trump hits Hillary via Bill people point out Bill is not running for president. It wouldn't be possible to play that off if her attacks included attacking Jeb! via W. Honestly, I don't think it would be a really close call if they ran Jeb!. A very sizable portion of the vote for Hillary isn't really pro-Hillary as much as it is anti-trump. If those votes were back in play, I think any generic candidate would win. And Jeb! is as generic as they come.

That's not enough to act unilaterally on any issue. Does it make it a bit harder for the Southern states to match their power? Yes. But why should the people of California have less of a say than Wyoming or Alabama? Our system was designed to appease whiny slave owners that knew they could not match up to the Northern states. The South, nor the Heartland, could not survive today as a modern nation. They lack the infrastructure, the financial capital, and the cohesive will. But they continue to act like ungrateful children, never willing to concede that their very way of governance is unsustainable. This isn't a question of small vs big state. Delaware, Hawaii and Rhode Island are small states and they'd be find with a popular vote for prez. This is a matter of the Union vs the Confederacy. The Confederacy has been itching to get its revenge, and they will use any means necessary to achieve that goal, even if it means bringing down the entire country.

Barron_Cyber	politics	2	-1	-1	2016-11	1478817025	I refuse to believe that I now live in a nation that doesn't give a shit about the dying, the sick, and the vulnerable. Everybody either knows somebody who has serious health issues in their life or died as a result of those issues, be it a battle with cancer, diabetes, MS, heart disease, or what have you. If the Republicans and Trump think they can get away with making a political issue out of that and denying those people insurance and coverage then they're going to be fucking shocked at what happens in response. You think we're divided now? Just wait until scores of ill and dying patients with no hope left for their recovery or survival take to the street in protest and start lighting shit on fire. We saw a similar movement in the 1980s when the AIDS epidemic swept the nation and Washington did nothing about it. Don't think it can't happen again just as fast if you take away the one thing that keeps them hanging on and fighting for their life everyday.

Then they lose to Democrats and the economy fulfills its destiny and tanks based on that policy. Dems come back and do good stuff, but it takes a long time to see the results. So, the Dem is out of office when the good results roll around and the Republican takes the credit. Rinse and repeat.

But protesting Trump in front of Trump Tower is a little like protesting the next rainstorm. Everyone in New York City already disagrees with Trump. The protesters aren't accomplishing anything. But, if they protest in, say, Toledo, Ohio, in a state that _did_ vote for Trump, it would put the representatives and senators from there on notice that people are watching, and that they better keep Trump on the straight and narrow -- or else it'll be their heads on the chopping block in two years time. New York politicians, at least those from the city, will vote against Trump no matter what. It's the rest of the country that needs some protesting done if it's to be effective.

Clinton didn't do that here; she simply apologized and this was the smart play. There was nothing for the moderator to press. *Trump* missed a huge opportunity here by not launching into a major attack; instead, he said a few words about her IT guy taking the fifth and then quickly moved on to defend his failure to release his tax returns. He was so rattled by her attacks on his wealth and debt that he completely surrendered his one chance to hit her weak spot. This was easily his biggest blunder of the night. He turned an exchange that should have been overwhelmingly in his favor into several minutes of desperately trying to defend his ego.

Most of the other current polls are centered around 7/29-8/1, immediately after the convention ended. They would probably show maximum bounce. This poll is 7/30 - 8/3 so it could reflect some cooling for Hillary after the immediate bump from the conventions. A lot of people here have actually convinced themselves that Trump has driven his poll numbers down because of what he's said this week, but that's not really knowable yet since most of the current polls were taken before most of the silly news stories this week. It could be that his numbers will actually rebound a bit in the next round of polls as the conventions bounces fade and things settle back to a more accurate level. Time will tell.

0	And Bernie would have crushed Trump even harder.	FuriousTarts	politics	4	4	0	2016-08	1470721253	What did you really expect? Trump beat the establishment and that is scary to any career politician. They tried everything they could to deny him the delegates to secure the nomination, but he still won. He is an outsider (to politics) that was voted in by a populous that is sick and tired of politicians that do nothing but lock up a cushy retirement and make their friends rich. I would bet you would see the exact same thing happening (with the Democrats) if Bernie were able to beat the DNC's rigged primaries.

0	Driving around looking at signs is not the same as taking a poll....	Nothing_Is_Strange	politics	11	-1	-1	2016-10	1476441517	I follow polls about as much as I follow the Kardashians, which is to say I don't. Polls are way to easy to manipulate. The media can quite easily skew a poll to say whatever they want it too. They do these polls by taking names off a list of registered voters. Those lists have the persons name and political party they are registered under. Call more democrats and the poll favors the democratic candidate and vice versa. The polls had Trump losing the primaries by several percentage points but as we all know, once the votes started being counted almost all the polls were wrong. It's an easy way to sway an election though. People see their candidate is losing by a lot and figure why bother voting, she/he is already going to lose. Do your own poll. Drive around for a day and see how many Hillary signs you see compared to Trump signs. I just drove from Tennessee to Florida and back and I would say there was at least a three to one advantage of Trump signs in peoples yards.

In fairness, the country used to have men, before that, gentlemen. Nowadays gentlemen are harder to come by and so are men. Being a Trump supporter, ive never tricked myself into thinking he was a gentlemen. Like a lot of men today, they can be a gentlemen when appropriate and a man when the social norms arent demanded. It was a hit, yes. Impeachable? No, unless he lied about it and commited perjury under oath. Like the dynamic duo does constantly. Trump as owned up to it and apologized for it. He said it was private locker room type talk. He isnt a politician, he's just a man. He also deflected a little and said Slick Willy said much worse on the gulf course. This, is absolutely true, I have no doubt. The cigar trick alone was much more graphic. Not to mention the whole epstein scandel. Long-time friend Jeremy Epstein was arrested for a pedophile ring. Why is this relevant? Because Bill boarded his plane 25 times and instructed his secret service detail to stay grounded. Thats highly unusual. Just in general for a ex pres, but also given whos plane he was boarding. I wish Trump had a smooth ride to the white house, but people need to know what theyre getting. A breath of fresh air compared to the last 8years which was a giant mystery and great efforts to keep it that way. I dont think this really a shock to most people, just good ammo for for divisive democratic tactics. The woman vote*

TheIcelander	politics	14	14	0	2016-06	1464813560	Nobody is saying everybody needs to go, but the simple reality is that robots and people in other countries are taking an increasing percentage of the jobs that don't require a college degree. The economy does need pipe fitters, except when they are replaced by automation. And even the ones that aren't replaced have a problem. The simple fact that it is a steady and rewarding profession means there is a long line of people waiting to get in. All of which ignores the fact that the pipes these men and women are fitting are designed by people with college degrees and used in projects designed by people with college degrees. So the demand for pipe fitters is in fact tied to those people who do need college degrees. An educated populace is one of the largest contributors to the success of a nation. The idea that a fixed amount of education, K-12, will continue to be adequate in an increasingly complex world is not a good one. The world has more things to learn than it did in the past. The idea that maintaining the same relative level of education among the populace can be achieved without increased amounts of education isn't logically sound. A couple of centuries ago an elementary level of education was fine for the average American. It then became a little more. Not too long ago it was a high school level. If the entirety of the world and the economy is changing and progressing , why on earth would we imagine our educational needs wouldn't also be changing and progressing?

Districts that should vote Democrat voting Republican and vice versa. It's ridiculous. We live in an era where things can easily be monitored, yet they're not.

The masses have been white middle aged christian men and women. The demographics are changing, and thus the tyranny of the masses is being corrected. You are seeing very spirited debates in the realm of human rights w.r.t LGBT, the ongoing battle against racism, gun laws, etc... All of the unreasonable things that were legislated upon in the past due to tyranny of the majority are being looked at again. Now what happens when a population who has traditionally received whatever it has wanted for the past 100 years suddenly... doesn't? They stamp their feet and cry like little children. That is exactly what is happening now as each of their terrible policies are being backed into a corner that they can't escape from.

All I hear her talk is bullshit rhetoric when she is not talking shit on Trump.

She is a woman! And we don't criticize women, they can't handle it like men can!""

SirLoondry	politics	5	5	0	2016-07	1469198995	I've been a delegate of both the DNC and the GOP. No one follows the platform on either side. In fact, I joined the GOP as a Democrat in an overwhelmingly red state because they had a massive demand for delegates in a large county and were experiencing a temporary shortfall during Ron Paul's campaign. I said what I needed to say in order to get in and make real change from within the party. What I discovered was delightfully astounding. The GOP in my state has more minorities in elected positions than any other State in the nation. We don't care if you are 5 feet tall and purple, we only ask that you make this nation a better place for everyone than when you got here. The GOP platform is extremely irrelevant and merely serves to pacify antiquated party extremists. It will change once there is a strategical need to change it, but you need not fear the ultimate goals of the Republican Party. Every human alive has an innate desire to make this nation a better place for us all.

Apparently this is a big deal for some reason, so morons like to blabber Drumpf as if it meant something. Frankly I'm surprised it has had the legs to go this long.

I don't doubt they love their child but I'm sure that an LGBT couple (even an individual) would probably be significantly better.

Donald Trump is *not* listening to sophisticated campaign strategists who measure the reactions of voters to attacks. These strategists know that negative attacks can help a candidate, so long as a voter doesn't associate that candidate with the attack. But Donald Trump is a narcissistic idiot, inside a bubble, inside and echo chamber lined with mirrors, and he doesn't listen to a damn thing that anyone tells him. Trump's base loves him because he dares to be a negative attack dog, but Trump's base doesn't equal 50% of the population. Trump's candidacy will forever be a textbook study of what *not* to do if you want to be president.

NWCitizen	politics	1	1	0	2016-06	1464828075	Its not that Sanders think that noone cares for the emails, its that a skandal isnt the road he wants to take to get the nomination. He wants to get his views out there, he wants to point to the many problems the US have in several areas, he wants to win on better policy. Bringing up the emails doesnt accomplish this. Plus he said he wouldnt do it way back, if he were turn around on this he would be no better than the liars hillary or trump are.

Maddison. In essence, the duty of the Court is to hear ""cases in controversy,"" and to say ""what the law is."" The court doesn't pick cases, or issue advisory opinions, or write laws. The legislatures (both state and federal) write laws, the executive enforces those laws - which could be, say, putting someone in jail for violating a drug law, deporting someone pursuant to immigration law, or fining a coal plant for violating environmental regulations - and then the duty of the court is to say: 1) did congress have the authority to enact that law; 2) did the executive enforce the law correctly; 3) does the Consitution prohibit the enforcement of the law; and finally 4) did the lower courts interpret the law correctly. You can see examples of many of these roles in this weeks cases,In the immigration case, the executive did not have the authority to enforce the law, in the abortion case the state legislature violated the constitution, and in the McDonnel case, the lower court misinterpreted the law as written by congress."

How about some responsibility for their actions? He had strong support but he wasn't the institution's choice. Corrupt politician isn't the choice of the people + Party leaders support corrupt candidate with corrupt practices = voters disenfranchised with a corrupt party and the Party doesn't win the national election.

But he will be painted as worse because the Establishment doesn't like his positions on the TPP (he's against it), healthcare (he wants to lower costs by making insurers compete with one another) or international relations (less interventionism, less dangerous saber rattling against Russia), all of which are better for the mass of people than Hillary's positions. I mean, Trump still kind of sucks, but it's a joke to think HRC is any better. And there is no use in defending her. She's a phony, a liar and for sale to the highest bidder.

I have no idea what to do if Sanders doesn't get the nomination. There are 3 choices really. 1. Vote for HRC. I personally have an issue with this, as it is rewarding the corrupt behavior of HRC and the DNC. 2. Support Trump. I feel like this has merit for only one purpose. It tells the DNC that their behavior has consequences. You can't just get away with it. Much like being a parent. Sometimes teaching your children is more work and consequences for you. But the longer term benefits are worth the short term pain. Except for the Supreme Court. Those are some lifelong consequences we are playing with. 3. Vote independent or write in Sanders. I really want to tell the DNC to F-off. And I feel like everyone not voting for HRC would do that. I also want to see a female president. But I want it to be a president who happens to be female, not a female politician who was forced into the role to be ""the first"", despite lacking qualification. I am so disgusted by the DNC and what they've done. Maybe 4 years of Trump would be a nice kick in the head for the DNC"

0	Exactly!	Spexes	politics	1	-1	-1	2016-10	1477331026	There's only one group of people in the world that *don't* want the unedited video released. 100% of them are die hard Trump supporters with an agenda. They want the propaganda, not the truth. The only way these unedited videos will be released is when O'keefe is sued again and is forced to reveal his source material as evidence... again. O'Keefe is making claims and accusations and this needs to go to court ASAP one way or the other. If he's right he has nothing to fear from discovery. If O'Keefe is right, then he will gladly release his unedited footage and take this to court to vindicate himself. If he's right, and he's uncovered some big fraud, he needs to cooperate and stop being shady. He is putting his 15 minutes of spotlight over the legitimacy of democracy itself. If he's really hit on some massive scandal he has an obligation to release his unedited footage. The way he's treating this whole thing indicates that he's just a fraud. Any legitimate evidence would have been immediately handed over to the press and the authorities.

It would carry into the presidential election as well, which would be a bad thing. He already instructed the DEA to back off of busting dispensaries and they basically told him to fuck off. They've already accused him of exceeding his authority on numerous occasions. Hell, how many times has the GOP tried to vote Obamacare down? They won't even let him choose a Supreme Court justice based upon a load of bullshit. And yet, we expect him to make a sweeping decision without any backlash. Honestly, I am happy he fought for healthcare over weed (and I'm trying to open a business in the industry) because it impacts more people and it was hugely needed. I still have hopes he does something as he leaves. I know it may be a pipe dream, but we've got to get the industry away from being cash-based as it encourages robberies and endangers employees. It's coming. I know we want it now, but once November hits and all these states vote on legalization, California is the key, we're going to see major changes.

I live in Australia with a good economy, high employment, great healthcare, a good university system and we don't have our fingers in so many pies of other people's business that our economy is fucked because we spend a trillion dollars on war each year.

That seems to be a large part of our problem as a country. It's happening in both parties. The leadership positioning itself to out flank the voters, if the votes cast don't go the way they like. If Clinton or Trump wins the nomination by popular vote they should represent their respective parties. If they don't have the support, then they should not. It's all fairly simple, until someone sticks their fat, dirty fingers in the pie. If and when the parties subvert the will of the voters they should expect the consequences. Those consequences may be minor or may just destroy the party's as we know them today. It looks like the GOP is more likely to fracture as of now. There is already a deep divide within the party. Some of the more conservative members have been revolting for some time now, but either could suffer from bad decisions.

0	*he also suggested executing the families of terrorists*	TheOneTrueTrench	politics	1	1	0	2016-05	1464462108	"I'm not gonna make the argument that he's a nazi because I feel like that's over the top language to use but there's one thing that always struck me as super odd about his campaign promises in that it genuinely mirrors nazi Germany. I'm of course talking about his ban on travel for Muslims. The ban itself isn't the issue, we've had bans on travel for groups of people in the past, what's odd to me is the necessity of defining Muslim-ness for the ban to be effective which will be eerily similar to the way in which Hitler genealogically defined the Jews so that they could be handled by government programs. Unlike nationalities or classes, religious identities are much harder for the government to work with because of how fluid and individualistic they tend to be. You can change your religious identity all you want as an adult, so this begs the question of how will Trump's proposed ban on Muslim travel work? We know that militants from the region are hiding themselves amongst the refugee population, so it's probably fair to assume that they'd lie about their religious background if it meant getting to where they want to be. So right off we can't just take people's word for it when they're declaring religious background like it's the census. How do we make sure that we're restricting the travel of Muslims then? The answer would likely be to tie Islam to parentage, essentially making it a racial rather than religious issue. This is the same thing that the nazis did to the Jews and why we can refer to a non-practicing person of Jewish descent as ""ethnically"" Jewish. Suddenly you're a Jew or a Muslim if your parents were Jews or Muslims despite your personal religious beliefs. Your religious identity becomes something that you inherit hereditarily, it becomes your race. Maybe there are some other alternatives to banning Muslim travel like just blanket banning travel to the Mid East but that doesn't restrict militants who have already smuggled themselves into Europe from traveling to America so that doesn't really fit the Don's message of safety first. But anyway that's my thoughts on the Trump/Hitler comparison. They're really over the top and not in anyway respectful to how genuinely horrible Hitler was, but wow some things are a little too similar for my taste."

When Kasich or Carson come off as the most sane, by virtue of speaking and shouting the least, good lord. The Republican Party is in a dire dire state.

She knows that there are *millions* of centrist Republicans that are going to be alienated in the general by Trump or Cruz, and her team is ready to go after them to crush the GOP. She will more than make up for losing some far left Bernie supporters by grabbing the middle. Therefore, she really doesn't want to keep sitting next to Bernie and have him rant about billionayhs and millionahs over and over - it potentially alienates moderate voters from both parties. Hardcore Bernie supporters just don't matter to her path to victory. Most dems are fine voting for Hillary, and nobody wins elections without the middle. It's just basic voting science."
0	I'm pretty sure Trump gets more hate than Clinton from Sanders supporters.	BlueNotesBlues	politics	2	2	0	2016-03	1459348498	It's the words used and yes the tone. Bitch is sexist. Calling attention to her wardrobe is sexist. Telling her to 'smile' is sexist. Criticising her for being a politician when men aren't getting the same vitriol used against them is sexist. You see it in reference to DWS as well. When certain Bernie fans react with such vitriol to women who are against them I ask why. When they send hateful misogynstic messages to Elizabeth Warren I ask why. And the language used when women agree with them is telling. They call her a 'real feminist' and crap like that. People can disagree with each other but when you are having such a vitriolic response to a female candidate and not to male candidates ask yourself why. A lot of it is subconscious. Hell I have to avoid it myself. We're drilled that being a woman is 'lesser'

0	This is the kind of analysis I was asking for.	Guido420	politics	4	4	0	2016-04	1461530211	If you want to think like a statistician, we want to know the answer a few questions: * If you were murdering people connected to the crisis in Flint, who would be on your hit list? Let's say the size of this list is N. I expect N is small, almost certainly 15 people or fewer, maybe as small as 5. Let's say N=10. * Given a list of randomly selected people in Flint, what is the chance that two people on our random list are murdered a few days apart? Homicide rate is something like 60 per year in Flint for a population of about 100,000. This is ~12 times higher than the nationwide rate, which is something like 5 per 100,000. Maybe that's where the 12 came from. Anyway, given a random list of 10 people, the a priori probability that two on the same list are murdered within a few days of each other is low. Quick estimate is that this probability is something like 60/10,000^2, or about 1 in 1.7 million. * Do you think that the probability that someone wants to murder people on our list *for reasons* rather than randomly is smaller or greater than 1 in 1.7 million? If we wanted to do this more rigorously we would be using Bayes' theorem.

Secondly, eating a pizza like that with a fork is pretty stupid and a mistake in this heavily NY Italian area. Finally I don't know why he would even come to this neighborhood of all places in NYC, the local Republican population consists of a bunch of guys longing for the days of the mafia, they are 100% on the TrumpTrain and will not be swayed.

1	Right, because Hillary is just as bad as Rubio.	AtlasSucked	politics	11	11	0	2015-11	1446383587	I cannot see myself voting for Hillary Clinton if she wins the nomination. Let me start out by saying that I've only just become interested in politics and am trying to become more informed. I rewatched the debate last night and more or less came to the same conclusion that I did when I watched it initially; Clinton had more air time than all of the other candidates and much of what she said was fluff. She made the comment about being a woman. She also said something else very painful that I am somehow forgetting. I know that the first debate was mostly an introduction to the candidates, but it seemed to me like she was playing it not to lose. In my opinion she didn't say much that could either be used to benefit or hurt her, depending on where your politics lie. Surely she couldn't hash out every one of her talking points, but to me she was outright not trying to say anything that someone could be critical of. If she firmly believed in her points wouldn't she have tried to spell them out more? I don't like the idea of someone being in power who in my opinion is guarded. How does Clinton make her decisions? I think Sanders and O'Malley went into the debate knowing where they stand and said they would fight for what they stand for while briefly saying what they do indeed stand for. Did we figure out where Hillary stands? That's a stark contrast for me. Hillary appears to be moving more to the left to match Sanders and O'Malley. Is she doing this so that there are fewer differences between her and them or is she doing this because of the polls? Either way, I am not sure where her head is at. I don't feel that her positions are necessarily what she personally believes should be done, but she takes them to be tactical. Sanders and O'Malley seem to want to get things done while Hillary might want to get things done after she receives advice or is told by one of her advisers where she should stand. I get the impression that Hillary wants to be president more than she wants to create positive changes.

After Obama won Iowa in 2008 the results were Obama 16, Clinton 15, Edwards 14 (and Edwards had more votes than Clinton). If you look back at 2008, Clinton only won 1 of the first 4 primaries/caucuses and she ended up tying on the delegate count of the state she did win. But she was still viable for a while. And she still has a shit-ton of superdelegates. Hillary couldn't go down until Super Tuesday at the very earliest.

When someone on one side says it will cause the GDP to shrink, lower income and increase poverty and someone else says the exact opposite, I am skeptical unless I can see at least some math behind the madness.

HolyCornHolio	politics	0	0	0	2016-03	1457944435	When are people going to acknowledge that there have and always will be emotionally unstable and potentially violent supporters on every side of an issue? It is completely possible that there are Sanders supporters who were acting hostile at the Trump rally. We've seen the same from Trump supporters. Sanders and Trump are public figures. Right now, all they are capable of doing are inspiring other people to pick up their message and gain an audience. They should be judged for their words and what they represent, not for the actions of someone wearing a t-shirt with their name on it. Now, after the fact, I would expect the candidates to comment on it - again, reiterate their message and clarify whether or not they encourage/discourage violence. But to blame Sanders for having an unstable ISIS sympathizer claim to be a follower is absolutely ridiculous, and the same goes for any Trump supporter who holds views that he as a candidate has not encouraged or endorsed.

1	If you don't support Israel 100% that means you hate Jews.	Im_no_cowboy	politics	2	2	0	2016-03	1457582176	According to Richard Cohen, you're an anti-Semite if you support a two state solution or question Israel's apartheid policies and support divestment campaigns (to force Israel to actually deal with the Palestinians instead of allowing more and more Jewish settlers into their country). None of those things are anti-Semitic because it's not hating the Jews. It's not calling for violence against Jews. It's using economic and political leverage to get a country to reconsider its internal/foreign policy in regards to people who've lived in the area for centuries. Anything that threatens Israel's power to regularly abuse Palestinians with no consequence is now considered anti-Semitic. And let's not forget how shittily Bibi Netanyahu has been treating the sitting President.

Yoga stuff and wedding stuff are a sub-category of that. Clinton and her staff say that those 30,000 deleted emails were personal in nature, which was a determination that she was qualified and entitled to make. So, because of the way burden of proof works, especially where wrongdoing is concerned: that's the baseline, and if you want to prove that they're *not* personal, you need some proof for that. And the bare allegation that this seems crazy to you, so they can't possibly all be personal, is not exactly proof.

The Obama comparison is relevant because you said she would move us ""two steps forward"" and Obama is, you know, our current president. -- She refuses to call herself a liberal, so no, she is not ""decidedly liberal"" -- Donors disagree with her being a liberal in the Energy and Global Warming front as well. -- She wants to build a ""fence"" as opposed to Trumps ""wall"" lol. -- Everything else you listed is the standard cookie cutter democrat position. Notice I said ""democrat"" and not ""liberal"" or ""progressive"". So no, still not ""forward"" In short, if you want to take her word for it, then sure, she is progressive, but her word is all we have to go by, because her record has been anything but consistent OR progressive. (TPP and trade in general, LGBT Equality, money in politics, mass incarceration, war, fracking, stance on the fossil fuel industry, ect.)

When he started moving up the ranks in politics, probably some focus group showed that there were perception problems with her having a different last name. So she started using ""Rodham Clinton"" when he was running for Arkansas Governor. Now that she's running for President, she is using Clinton. She completely got rid of references to Rodham, even though that's her legal name. Again, probably because of a focus group. Name recognition. Happy times. Nostalgia. But her email address was hrod17. The 17 is a reference to Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017. Hrod is obviously her own perception of what her identity is. So she's saying that Hillary Rodham will be president on January 20, 2017. Not Hillary Clinton. Shaping public perception is a huge thing. Like the illusion that Bill and Hillary are still married. I would be greatly surprised if they spent one night a month under the same roof, let alone in the same bed. But the focus groups say that if they were divorced, or perceived to be separated, it would be looked upon negatively. So the illusion is continued."

I don't know anyone who does either. What concerns me isn't really the A+B=C equation but more the unintended side effects of being bombarded by violence. Penalizing people for showing that stuff to kids is not the answer, i dont have any answers, but i think its important to see that by being inundated with it visually all day every day creates a perception of normalcy... which to me is a concern.

What happened in the financial crisis was that the losses were greater than the money the banks saved in the piggy banks so banks across the world needed their governments to give them money so that they had enough to cover all that the banks owed. When you put money in a bank, it treats that as money it owes to you and then lends it to someone else. The money it lends to someone else it regards as an asset and the money it owes to you is a liability. The amount that it can lend out is stipulated by regulation but it does not need to hold enough money in reserve to pay out to all of its depositors (that is why it is fractional reserve banking). When more people want to take out money than the bank has in reserve then it is known as a ""run"" on the bank (and is bad). By demanding that banks hold larger reserves, they should be more resilient in the future to the poor performance of assets without needing governments to step in and give them money so that they are able to pay out to their customers as necessary. (The above is all rough hand waving and not intended to be technically correct.)"

When you interpret the actual results of a poll to come up with the reported percentage figures, you're relying as much on the data you receive as you are a comparison to history. And in Michigan, it was especially hard to do that. In 2008, Obama wasn't on the ballot. In 2004 and 2000, there weren't primaries; Michigan held caucuses instead. So you have to go back 24 years to 1992 to find circumstances remotely similar. And the problem there is that you're going back 24 years.

Cant_ban_the_Trump	politics	-2	-2	0	2015-12	1450557492	"The Republican's/Conservative's new favorite code word- ""politic correctness"" The GOP and Conservatives have always been fond of code words as often the message they are sending or the concept they are selling is too morally reprehensible to be spoken out loud. In the past there was the infamous ""Southern Strategy"" that Nixon and the GOP employed to recruit racists and bigots from the southern Democratic party (owing to the civil war and Lincoln being a Republican) to their own banner. Later on they used the code words ""state's rights"" as a way of nicely wording their opposition to civil rights for all. They have used it as well with their ""pro life"" position which really represented forced birthing and denial of woman's rights. The list goes on and on and now the latest favorite word is ""political correctness"". Now they try and make on believe that ""political correctness"" is a term for those who have gone extreme in their efforts not to offend anyone. Yet the reality is the GOP and Conservatives are talking and using the word with much more sinister connotations. What they mean by ""political correctness"" is treating everyone equally and with respect. When they say they oppose ""political correctness"" what they are endorsing is the concept of tyranny by the majority"" against various minorities. They are talking being free to be a racists or a bigot when they say they oppose political correctness. Now doubt it's working as all of the neo-nazi and white supremacist groups who have endorsed a presidential candidate have endorsed a Republican one"

InFearn0	politics	1	1	0	2015-12	1450293221	I agree with most of the sentiments here. I can't think it would be the right, or pragmatic, thing to do to jail a woman for having an abortion. However I'm possibly in favor of a cut off where the doctor might be punished or fined for performing the procedure after a period of time. I think that does increase the chance of 'back alley' abortions which is unfortunate. After the cut off (whatever time period that might be, how could you ever really know) I think the fetus should be birthed and put up for adoption. We could also increase the financial incentive for other families adopting children. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of terminating a pregnancy extremely close to birth. It seems unnecessarily cruel. It further blurs the line between a medical procedure and killing a baby. For the record I'm a male and will never have to have an abortion so maybe my opinion is skewed. No less valid, but skewed.

The immigrants that came over through Ellis Island weren't required to have immediate family US citizens or have a job lined up before hand. Today's immigrants have to jump through a ton more hoops. And we wonder why they just opt to hop the fence.

In her autobiography she says that she worked her way through grad school and was living paycheck to paycheck until she landed her first teaching job, completely glossing over how her first husband supported her financially and helped get her the teaching job (there's nothing wrong with that, just in her misrepresentation of it). She also made public statements condemning the practice of house flipping as hurting working class families despite the fact that she made a lot of money doing just that in the 90s. Then there's the whole playing up an unprovable Native American heritage in order to get tenure at Harvard. As to why specifically she hasn't endorsed Bernie, the Democratic Party won't let her.

But other countries aren't going to play along with that, they don't give a shit, intelligence operations will continue or even ramp up in response to dismantling the CIA... I mean, if they don't continue intelligence operations, they'd be willingly endangering American citizens. If they do, they are going to have to hide information from citizens. The only way to stop it is if every country agrees to stop simultaneously, and I bet that'd last about 3 seconds. No superpower is going to agree to no more espionage.

I will still vote Clinton should she win the nomination and you should too because it's what bernie will want you to do. The reason being the voting system is flawed, first past the post and unlimited finances see to that. The next president will be making 2 to 3 scotus appointments and those justices will be deciding the future of election rules for centuries. If Clinton makes those appointments then we have a chance to elect a more progressive candidate like Sanders in 2024. If instead you vote third party you are adding to the Republican lead, effectively removing votes from the plausible candidate most likely to support your values. Voting third party doesn't fix the dnc or send a message, it gives Republicans a chance to make sure the system remains broken for centuries and that's reality.

Both result in keeping the poor from gaining wealth. UoP and other for-profit schools target the uninformed and convince them that the low cost and convenience will still result in a gain in human capital that will be respected in the market. Sadly, few employers place value on these degrees and they are virtually worthless in a competitive job market. To similar effect a consumption tax system where there is no income tax, just high tax on consumption, creates a poverty trap for the poorest of the poor. It does this by preventing savings. If you need to spend your entire pay check to eat, pay rent, etc then a consumption tax only works to increase your cost of living without raising your spendable income. We ought to be working to break poverty traps, not blatantly create them...but that's only if you care about poor people to begin with. *looking at you, GOP candidates*

Trump only want's to take the 4th amendment, and the only candidates who don't are Sanders and Rand Paul, who will very likely not win the nomination. So between Hillary and almost any other republican, the republican will probably win, at least in my book because my rights are the single most important issues for me. Oh and for the record I think the fact that we don't have a choice to keep the 4th amendment just shows how far into degradation we've gone.

I'd never deny that. It's a huge problem and needs to be addressed. But that wasn't the right point to address it. At that time with that question, the American people wanted to hear how exactly a candidate would do damage control in that region and that wasn't how Sanders responded.
0	"Not that I don't think it's ethically sketchy, but ""living abroad"" is a bit of a stretch."	Zfusco	politics	0	0	0	2016-01	1453066233	"Something tells me he's not going to be missed by the people on the secret kill list. It's not like Republican obstructionism or an antagonistic media are responsible for the default characterization of those killed as militants or the creation of a secret list of people we can assassinate without any kind of due process. Bush may have been responsible for kidnapping people and holding them indefinitely without trial, but it was President Obama who ordered an American citizen living abroad assassinated, and who has a list no one else is allowed to see. And he probably won't be missed by people who are going to be victims of the next big market crash caused by under-regulated financial firms. While it's understandable that the administration couldn't get through strong new legislation because the legislative branch of our government may be broken forever, he could have directed federal investigators and prosecutors to go after bankers. Obviously, Obama does have some big victories under his belt, like managing to pass a real stimulus bill during a recession (which is what's supposed to happen during a recession), the most substantive healthcare reform in decades, ending the Iraq War, saving the American car manufacturing industry from itself, ending ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", the Iran nuclear deal, and signing START, but I think we have to be realistic when we look back on presidents or any elected officials. If Clinton or Trump or Cruz are elected, we'll certainly miss Obama. If Sanders somehow manages to get elected, Obama will be seen for what he was: a moderate neoliberal who compromised more than he needed to."

This is not the question we should be engaged in, as every article tries to point out. The question should be, why do Republicans (and only Republicans) continually make laws that make voting even slightly more difficult than it is today. Voter ID laws tend to hurt women more (they are more likely to have their name not match exactly). They also tend to effect the poor more as it is slightly more difficult for them to get to the DMV during open hours. Republicans absolutely 100% know this. It is the only logical motivation for such laws.

He brought me hope. Some of your criticisms might even have a little weight to them like the NDAA and the crackdown on Snowden, but your rhetoric is so off-the-chart from reality.

McCain owes veterans today an apology. How often has McCain made decisions that didn't benefit service members? McCain was opposed the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act. How much effort has McCain put into heath care for returning veterans? He put more effort into saying the service members are not professional enough to do their job if there was a known gay in the area, and didn't object to 15 month tours, because that they can handle. Again, what has McCain done to help service members repair marriages after being gone for 15 months? Help veterans get fair child custody agreements when the spouse takes off with the children since the other was gone for so long? What has he done about the drug and alcohol abuse from all the deployments? I'm sure he is for service members getting some THC in their system to help to combat PTSD, and other medical issues that plague service members. The suicides? The sexual assaults? How hard did McCain try to be president, so he can send more service members into countries, with his sweet battle song ""Bomb bomb Iran!""? And Trump is right about McCain being captured. How reckless was he flying planes? About as reckless as he is with everything else in life, like always trying to find ways to send other service members into harms way, with the possibility of being captured themselves. McCain is being given credit for following rules once in his life, which is don't leave your fellow service members behind. And Trump is right about the lack of care McCain has given service members."

Because if it legitimately was. You'd still be on it. Plans that conformed with the ACA existed prior to the ACA. Plans with low oop expenses and no lifetime maximums. They still exist and the people who were on them didn't even notice a change. Likely your old plan was made illegal because it exceeded the annual out of pocket expense maximum set by the ACA which is now around 6,000. Likely your old plan had a lifetime maximum coverage amount. Meaning that after a week in the ICU. You would have used all of your insurance benefits and be on your own financially for the rest. At about 200 dollars a minute not including the drugs. Your plan was made illegal because it was shit. And if you got really hurt, you would have been like most people who get sick with shit insurance. Filing chapter 11 bankruptcy. But blame Obama. He is the badguy. Not the company that sold you a product knowing full well it would not work when you really needed it too. They actually designed it to not work when you really needed it too. Personally I wish that people like you could opt out of the ACA. On the provision that you forfeit your right to file bankruptcy when you incur 800,000 in medical bills. You should be allowed to be permanently and cripplingly indebted for the rest of your natural life.

Until late one night, I couldn't sleep, so I began flipping through channels. I stumbled upon CSPAN, and it was a Congressional hearing questioning the DA for pressing charges on that police officer. The DA replied,"" it wasn't the act that we were arresting him for, but rather the cover up of his actions. How he, and his colleagues tried to cover up the truth of that action is why we arrested them"".

Catholic priests refuse to perform wedding ceremonies for any number of reasons - the couple is not catholic, the couple will not sign a form stating they will raise their children as Catholics, etc. So, the government is no longer allowed to discriminate against same sex couples who apply for a license. As far as I know, there is nothing in the Supreme Court decision that says churches must alter their current guidelines about who can hold their marriage ceremony in a particular church. A marriage license is a civil contract. A marriage ceremony may be a religious observance, but does not have to be.

JessaHannahBluebel	politics	14	14	0	2015-04	1429248976	For a couple, the first **$11 million** is exempt from the tax. Only that part of the value of the estate **above $11 million** is subject to the tax, and that assumes that these multi-millionaire famers didn't do any planning to avoid the tax. For active family farms, an additional $1.1 million can be exempted. In 2013, fewer than 5,000 total estates in the US were subject to any estate tax at all. Of those, an estimate puts the total number of farms who had to pay any estate tax in 2012 at *120*. That's it. If they had to pay $5 in estate tax, they were in that 120. Also, many of the estates that included farm land and paid estate tax were simply super wealthy people who happened to own some farm land as part of their overall cash+stocks+houses+companies+farmland estates. I'd gladly pay 40% of $4 million on an inheritance of $15 million, and walk away with $13.4 million. (For an effective tax rate of 10.7%) I'd be better off than if I had to pay income tax (AMT) on $15 million in income in one year.

Then when the leading indicators show a period of contraction you decrease rates to support growth. The issues with bubbles is they grow at an unsustainable rate. When they pop they can cause very turbulent period of time that adds to uncertainty and elongates the time it takes to stabilize the economy.

ReconWaffles	politics	-4	-4	0	2015-09	1441652622	Our standard of living is extremely good in the U.S. The problem is, the core demographic of reddit is college age students. And as such they have very little money. When I was in college just a few years ago I was working shitty jobs trying to make it through class and eating ramen every night. Now I have a 70k salary in low cost of living area, I also make about 20k a year on side work. I was able to buy a house and afford to have my wife stay at home with our kid. It's really amazing that this has been able to happen. I got into the attitude that I would always be struggling because I read about it so much on reddit. I just wish that redditors would not be so short sighted and know that they will be able to make a very comfortable living in a few years if they work for it. Part of the problem is that reddit highlights all the people strugglign and never the successful ones. In every circle jerk it's always the post about someone who got a PHD and is living in their parents basement, it's never about the average college student that got a degree and is now making 50+k a year right out of college. It really makes people have a warped reality.

1	Racist	mrpoodles11	politics	1	1	0	2015-10	1445316450	You could write a book on this . . . but I will attempt the nutshell; Race is deeper than mere skin color. It also carries with it cultural baggage, and, most especially in the U.S., historical legacies. The modern day product of such are the massive differences in life outcomes. I'm not going to cite for these claims, but I will if you disagree with their generalities: Blacks and Latinos are far less wealthy than white people, in rates of home ownership, largely stemming form the 1930-1970 policies of redlining and mortgage denial. Incarceration rates are much higher as well, as we all know. Representation in the booming fields of healthcare and technology are also a fraction of those of Asian and Caucasian descent. Thus, the majority of wealth creation and income *still* flows, quite disproportionately, into White and Asian hands. That's not even touching the 1% v.s. 99% divide. Thus, the fact of the matter is is that the United States has absolutely powerful vested interests in keeping things pretty much the way they are. I'm not talking about the Koch brothers. I'm talking about middle class whites that get the benefit of the doubt at court, who hate spending anything on welfare if it goes to the ghetto, lower interest rates on mortgages that reinforce the status quo. A huge chunk of the population that straddles Republican and Democratic parties. Denmark, for example, has NONE of this to contend with. I can't remember the last time a race riot took place. I can't remember a Ferguson, MO. They don't have the war on drugs (war on poor blacks). Walk down a street in Copenhagen, and there is no fear if you walk through a poor neighborhood. Why? Because the people living there are just like you! People have more empathy with those who are like them. Hence, the greater social cooperation among homogeneous populations, which is *fundamentally* what a welfare state requires.

I'm not religious but if I were, the CIA would be the closest thing to Satan on this good green Earth in my opinion. The CIA taught the Iranian Shah's secret police how to employ torture techniques. They did the same in a bunch of South American nations. They helped Saddam attack Iran with nerve gas. They've installed too many murderous dictators to count. They operated torture/death camps in Vietnam the Nazis would've envied. More recently, they ran a ring of clandestine torture facilities around the world. They're responsible for such a mind-boggling amount of death and suffering, and such unspeakable crimes against humanity, it all defies description. Al Qaeda is their creation, and so is ISIS. What a terrifyingly evil organization.

I'm not aware of very many ""failing"" public school systems in wealthy neighborhoods. Remember, elimination of public education has long been one of the rights cherished goals. Consequently The FOX/Limbaugh/GOP bullshit machine^TM has worked overtime for 20 years trying to convince people that all public schools are failing. That's mostly not the case.

His entire campaign was about an outsider fighting a filthy and corrupt Washington, so when he got there, he had to face a speaker and a Senate that he'd spent a year calling crooks. He also never bothered to learn how Congress operates, and had a habit of publicly lambasting anyone who attached pork or deal-sweeteners to legislation that got to his desk. He insulted people, and invoked Jesus and Thomas Jefferson to bitch about how he was the only decent person in Washington. After a while, people got sick of his bullshit. And then there were the televised addresses, where he lectured Americans that they wasted too much energy, drove big cars, and just didn't spend enough time worrying about the environment or human rights abuses on other continents. He was a moralizer, a crusader, and Americans just decided he was full of shit. I'm not saying Bernie is that bad, because he's not, but Americans have little patience for leaders who tell them what they're doing wrong.

TheBroodian	politics	1	1	0	2015-10	1445406395	Something I always think about is this: Disregarding the whole supply and demand thing for a moment, if person a gets paid less than person b for work, that literally means the time of person a is less valuable than the time of person b. How does that make sense? We're all human, everyone likes to have time, how is one persons time more valuable than anothers? And so extremely so in some cases. Supply and demand is also a somewhat bad justification because if there is a demand market, wouldn't it be societies responsibility to fulfil that demand by training more people? It works for a moment, but does it really work for a time scale of 30 years + where lawyers and doctors get consistently more pay than other professions? As a side note, I could do manual labor, I have no problem doing it, but if it means that more important work that would help more people isn't done, I feel I have an obligation to rather do that.

If the representative is incapable of sticking to the issues, requires lobbyists to direct their vote, or can't keep up with current trends, then they have no business pretending to represent whom they clearly know nothing about. This means that they will have to work for a living, much like everyone else. None of these BS fundraising events, none of these parties, none of these backroom deals. It ends. They have to pay attention. It's not the citizen's job to go out of our way to inform politicians when we pay them so much and they keep up so poorly.

ViaRoarUgh	politics	11	11	0	2015-06	1433193392	You could argue that current economic policy in the US doesn't encourage investment as much as accumulating wealth, which is bad for the economy overall. The market will likely eventually correct itself to an extent to mitigate lagging consumer spending, but as long as the government is content to continue expanding the deficit to subsidize low wages and exploding debt (and as long as the Fed is content printing money and absorbing toxic debts from the financial sector), I think that it's unlikely that the economy will return to the relative stability of the post-WW2 era.

Ideologically motivated, justified, and peaceful protests that are quickly followed by an almost entirely different crowd motivated by opportunism to run riot and steal whatever they want. They see the protests as a sign that the Police can't possibly catch everyone or be everywhere, and so no-one can stop them, and so do whatever they think they can get away with. Honestly you see the same thing on a much smaller scale every day. People are often more held back by the thought that they can't get away with something than they are by morality or the idea that it'd hurt people they don't know. Of course, in London the riots were followed by much larger crowds banding together to clean up the mess and destruction, to support those whose lives and businesses were destroyed, and to condemn the actions of a relative minority of selfish opportunists hiding under the banner of a cause they don't understand or care about (check out those interviews with some of the London looters, if you want to see what I mean.

Reagan used to famously long for the times before medicare as ""when men were free"". MLK was called socialist, communist, Marxist, and every other name in the book by the right when he fought for equality. Republicans/libertarians call anything and everything that improves the lives of average American as communist or socialist, forced redistribution, etc etc. It's became a buzzword designed to generate a Pavlonian response in the right wing voter base. 1% of the voting public, maybe even less, can accurately define what socialism and communism are, and the power of these buzzwords lie in the remnants of cold war propaganda. As that generation dies off, they become less effective as scary words. Maybe it's time for an American president to say in public ""Inequality threatens the fabric of American society. I want to redistribute some wealth back to the 99%."" I think American voters will be receptive."

0	In congress, sure, republicans are doing well Nationally, the democrats have a structural advantage in the electoral college and have won 5 of the last 6 popular votes, with most of them being by rather healthy percents - 2012 = 3.86% - 2008 = 7.27% - 2000 = 0.5% - 1996 = 8.51% - 1992 = 5.56%	fooey	politics	1	1	0	2015-02	1424392463	I think you underestimate how many people just generally loathe Hillary Clinton. And how much money hate Elizabeth Warren. If it's Hillary, the republicans will get 30% of voters to come out in opposition to health care and abortion. If it's Warren, the conservatives will lambast her as an ivory tower intellectual who is out of touch with the needs of blue collar folks. Either way, the core of the campaign will be based on how bad Obama was and how any republican is better than any democrat, because the GOP will bring America back to Reagan's glory days. It's all utter nonsense, but utter nonsense has led to a pretty decent winning streak for Republicans in Congress. Why won't it continue for the presidency? Except for Bush Sr., the Presidency has changed parties in every open election since WWII. If there's one thing America consistently likes to do in presidential elections, it's try something different. Because times are never as good as they could be, and trying something different is always the intuitive choice. Democrats will have a solid uphill battle in this election even if the Republicans decide to run a divisive figure like Paul Ryan or another Bush. To win, the Democrats will essentially need to overcome five years of ineffective messaging, while the republicans need only convince voters that their guy likes beer and burgers.

Canadian_Infidel	politics	1	1	0	2014-07	1405207076	I'm not denying that this happens, but I'm confused as to why this isn't a self-limiting problem. If the H-1's that are getting hired are consistently under qualified or have enough communication difficulties to prevent them from doing their jobs correctly, why continue to hire them even at below-market rate? I would think that if you have enough people at a company who are unable to perform their jobs properly eventually either your product will suffer in quality or more people will need to be hired to fill the productivity gap (therefore eliminating the benefit of hiring workers below market wage). It doesn't matter how little you pay someone if they're not doing their job and slowing the productivity of your staff that are doing their jobs properly. Paying people 25% less isn't cheaper if you have to hire 30% more people to get the job done. If I were an employer, I'd much rather hire someone for market rate who is reliable and productive than take a gamble on a worker who is cheap but potentially will negatively impact how my business runs.

He did not attack the police. He did not encourage people to attack the police. Exactly the opposite. This is exactly what the police should *support*. The police should *support* making the force better. Then two cops were killed. How do the police respond? By accusing de Blasio's criticisms as the cause for the murder and basically declaring war against the mayor. They then ask for no protests until after the funerals, but then *hypocritically protest* ***AT*** *the funeral itself*, wielding the deaths of their fellow officers as a political weapon in a partisan attack against bettering the police. They have disgraced themselves and the memory of the fallen officers in a disgusting display of angry, idiotic immaturity. The NYPD has proven itself despicable and need to purge these radical elements from their ranks. And I'm someone who is typically more pro-police. (For example, I don't think Darren Wilson did anything wrong, nor do I think that there's any evidence that Ferguson or Garner were racist events, although I do think indictments should have occurred in both scenarios. Wilson should have then been found innocent.)

I think back fondly to a time when Democrats were outraged, if impotent, by Presidential overreach. Should a Republican take back the White House, or should a Republican majority control the House and Senate, I expect things will follow much the same course they have for the past eight years (barring the existence of a Republican supermajority, which seems unlikely). The only real difference under such a government, and the little consolation we might enjoy, may be that more people on the left will express outrage--feigned though it may be--when outrageous acts are once more committed by Republicans in power rather than by Democrats.

He specifically said Eric Garner, eye for eye and nothing else. That's the point, nothing about his actual reasons or thoughts are outright detached from reality, they are essentially opinions on frustration at having ""no justice"" for Eric Garner. Clearly he performed the ultimate act of selfishness...but with sound mind. He killed his former girlfriend and wanted to go out with a bang. It's easy to write off someone that makes a manifesto with wild accusations. This person didn't do that though, they appeared very lucid, just angry and selfish. It's not correct to write all these incidences off as just ""crazy people"", if they were then they wouldn't be responsible for their actions. If we concede that every human being is capable of extreme selfishness while still being of sound mind, we can treat the problem seriously and with due respect. Terrorists aren't called ""crazy"", this guy wasn't. He was an asshole and he wanted to believe that his actions would be of benefit to the African American community, it's pretty clear."

My guess is that climate refugees and resource wars are going to be a big problem in this century, but we'll continue to soldier on. If you're really concerned about this, don't buy coastal property, check with a geologist as to what elevation your house would be at, don't go nuts with the number of kids (1 or 2 is fine), and install stuff like geothermal heating/cooling, windmills, LED lighting, and solar panels to help lower your carbon footprint. Doing that might not add up to a lot compared to what people in general are doing, but at least you can control how much you contribute to the problem.

But people spend their time on their professions, most people don't have time to go and physically campaign for their respective candidates, so they contribute the money which they've earned from their work. Money = man/hours = speech. You would not say that these people don't have the right to physically campaign for their candidates, unfortunately, most people don't have that luxury of time, their money is equivalent to their time, and it is completely legitimate for them to contribute it as such to a candidate they support, secretly, as no one should feel pressured into a political stance. What it boils down to is people thinking this means corporations are going to buy politicians, but all corporations can do is prop up the suggestion of a given candidate for office, it is always ultimately the voters who decide who will take office. To think money buys elections is an extremely cynical position on American democracy. Meg Whitman learned that money is only as good as the candidate when she lost to Jerry Brown in the Cali gubernatorial election having outspent him 5 to 1 (178.5 mil to 36.5 mil).

The strength of free markets is their ROBUSTNESS to blind greed and character flaws. Those same human limitations in a command economy are much more destructive than in a free market economy. In a market economy greed is funneled into socially beneficial behavior (e.g., if you want to make a lot of money, you must think of a good or service to provide in order to do that). In a command economy it is funneled into activities that rob the public of money without providing anything. And the fact is that you can hardly evaluate historic events as a criticism of markets because markets throughout history have existed in the context of laws and lots of other things that completely change the calculus.

Throughout the book I kept wishing that he had stayed hidden under his grandmother's house while it burned down. Then I wouldn't have to read that horribly boring book. Beloved by Toni Morrison was a much better book dealing with race. It was spiritually draining to read, but it actually made me feel for the characters and helped me to understand how horrible racism is. I spent 12 years of grade school reading books that tried to make me feel horrible about racism and slavery, and this was the only book I read that wasn't a waste of time (I read it in college though). Now, on topic, I think that calling the joke racist is a stretch. At worst, you can call it in bad taste for advocating the murder of a president.

This sounds like ""Hey guys, we can't afford tanks anymore, so kindly fuck off"" Whereas what I was told about early wars in the US was ""Hey guys, we don't need tanks anymore, so go use your skills to build some cars or shit, whatever people are currently buying"" Are companies so inflexible now that they can't retool? Why don't some of these companies start working on green energy tech, or something else that is currently booming? It's like we're at a point where our excuse is ""We need to keep building shit we don't need / want to keep the economy up""....which kinda seems to defeat the entire idea of 'free market' that people always talk about."

Before you jump to conclusions, another source who had seen the data noted that the locations of the duplicate voters were primarily in areas where Republicans had a won, and offsetting the margins would have required a much larger number of votes than had been detected, implicating that possibly the fraud was Republican in nature and being used to shore up numbers in areas where they feared upset losses by close margins. Im not really in favor of voter ID's but I am in favor of information. Whats irritating is the study was deliberately limited in its scope by BOTH sides, which to me indicates they both fear that something might be found to implicate themselves.

If Congress authorized all of this spending, and didn't authorize the tax revenues to support it, there are two logical ways to accomplish the spending: Borrow the money you need, or print it. We don't like printing money because that adds to inflation and lowers the value of the dollar and so forth, so what else are you going to do? Besides, given the 14th Amendment and all, it looks to me like a debt ceiling vote would be superfluous, anyway. Congress agreed to take on the debt when it voted to spend the money. So, why are we talking about a vote that, for all intents and purposes, already happened?

This sounds counter intuitive at first, but follow me for a little bit and I'll see if I can express myself. The US has provided stimulus money to the people (some of which were very rich). The idea was that people will take that money and go shopping, which gives the economy a boost, and then everyone can ride the wave. Sort of like boosting a car. A small jolt, the alternator kicks in and the battery recharges itself. Of course, the way this stimulus package was distributed worked more like giving a boost to the license plate and expecting the car to turn over. Clearly the money was not applied to the correct area. But that was the fundamental idea. A Work Program would be very much like a stimulus package (and is, technically one), with a few differences. The first is that you are only directly stimulating the unemployed or underemployed. Second, you are getting a necessary service out of it. The US *needs* to improve its infrastructure. This has to happen, the question is now or later, realizing that the more ""later"" it is, the more it will cost. Once you get these people working, paid for by themselves via taxes (which is also a point that needs adjusting - for this to work best, raising taxes on the rich to subsidize the program is best), they begin pumping that money into the economy. This opens up new jobs in service industries and in manufacturing. If everyone starts buying new clothes, the clothes reseller will hire more cashiers and stock-people. I see the work program as a stepping stone towards igniting the entire economy."

0	Confirming someones right to vote does not turn their right into a privilege, however I agree with the rest of your post.	rubberstuntbaby	politics	0	0	0	2012-08	1345482738	The problem is that requiring a government issued ID card turns the *right* to vote into a *privilege* to vote. The petitioner must get permission from the state(in the form of an ID card) in order to cast a vote, but the state sets the conditions under which the ID is issued(cost, what kinds of IDs are available, where they can be obtained, *when* they can be obtained). Moreover, it demands that the ID be checked for authenticity at the polling location, because if it isn't there's really no point in issuing one in the first place. This will introduce delays to the voting process, reducing participation as people run out of time or patience to wait in long lines. More critically, polling volunteers are in a unique position to disenfranchise certain voters by simply declaring their IDs invalid or fake. This can happen as a result of poor training(they're volunteers) or active attempts at manipulating the vote. Hurdles should not be placed in the voting process unless they are necessary to address real and demonstrable problems. If there is no problem with the current system, there is no need to implement a new system. If it isn't broken, don't try to fix it.

Most I know of aren't anywhere near wealthy. The Tea Party people who are sending their kids to private school or are home schooling them are probably doing it because they're religious. Truly wealthy people send their kids to different kinds of private schools for different reasons, I would guess, but it probably has more to do with old money tradition, getting a ""better"" education, and so forth. I don't believe that they simply want their children to continue exploiting the poorer classes. They're just doing what they've always done: go to that nice prep school, get into that Ivy League university, graduate, be groomed to take daddy's place. I don't think it's about anything more than that."

What is REALLY messed up though is that the new generation of reactors can actually USE DEPLETED FUEL! Which is then only radioactive for a few hundred years instead of thousands!!!!!!!!

As an Engineer, I disagree. Humanity has been mechanizing since the 1200's, but human control was always necessary. Machines were only as good as their skilled operators. Now we have figured out how to remove human control. Machines run the machines that run the machines that run the machines. Human labor is becoming obsolete at an alarming rate, and the humans being displaced cannot be retrained for the jobs that are being created. This is not to say that the workers aren't capable, it is just that one technician can maintain enough machines to replace a few hundred workers. There isn't enough demand for a supply system that is automated AND augmented by human workers. The only way would be a system where each machine had a dedicated technician, which makes no sense economically, therefore it won't happen. Humans need to accept the reality that we live with: Human labor is no longer necessary. If the human capital isn't needed, then the human laborers aren't getting paid. If the humans have no pay, they can't buy anything. If they can't buy anything the economy collapses. If there is no pay to the labor force, and the labor force can't buy anything, then manufacturers eventually have to give their products away or watch them rot in a warehouse. Automation is bringing about communism...whether you like it or not.

The overwhelming majority of people (not just Americans) only pay slight attention to their country's politics, but will form strong opinions on things based on the first thing that's said that kind of makes sense and/or fits their preexisting narrative. So, if Republicans made that bill pass the House they could have turned around and blamed Obama/the Senate for not saving us from the fiscal cliff. Therefore Democrats are the ones to blame and Republicans are the saviors of mankind. Even though the more informed amongst us know it means nothing, because it would never pass the Senate, it would mean a lot to your average voter.

They will plaster this person's face on every TV for a week or two, talk in depth about the gun he chose to use, etc. They will make him a celebrity; notice how many shootings have been going on since Sandy Hook? I have no actual evidence but I do believe that is in part to the huge media response to that particular shooting and the ongoing debates (gun control, mental health, etc) that are all centered around that event. I think the media is part of the problem right now.

0	The middle class has been shrinking since the 80's, the '08 recession just sped it up slightly.	Roast_A_Botch	politics	1	1	0	2014-01	1390153701	If I may ask, what do you find to be the best alternative? I know the middle class is shrinking, but I see that as the cuts during the recession of late 2007. Companies were downsized to curb liabilities and increase efficiency to make it through the recession. Now we're in a state where the lower class doesn't buy because it can't afford, the middle class is too scared to consume and invest, and the upper class is too scared to invest since no one is consuming. The upper class is hoarding the money, just like every American because they are scared. Besides raising wages, I see no alternative. Fighting the problem would be raising wages. Taking someones money is not the solution. Raising taxes would be beneficial, but would lead to less money invested. I'm coming from a business school background, so I know my perspective is extremely skewed.

CEOs have a lot of pull in establishing and guiding company policy and culture, so unless there's been an almighty turnaround at Bain since Romney left, I don't see that it's unfair to take into account the company the man used to keep and, indeed, direct.

It then proceeds to estimate the economic impact of those workers if their pay was increased. But isn't it assuming that all 27.8 million workers would keep their jobs? Seems to me, that if a business suddenly has to pay their minimum wage staff more per person, many of them would choose, instead, to let a few of them go.

The same issue also massively undermines the value of a degree as well as massive over &amp; under production of graduates in various areas which is precisely why we have retail positions seeking undergraduate degrees and so many people have trouble finding work in their field. A couple of very easy changes would correct this problem; * Subsidized loans massively increase economic mobility which is a good thing. Means tested subsidized loans (means tested to a much greater extent then they are now, we should be targeting the bottom 50% of households not the top 90%) should continue to be offered but should have a hard limit on value based on the cost of a state school. * Subsidized loans should be offered beyond this based on anticipated demand for skills (BLS already publish this data) rather then student demand. If BLS anticipate we will only need 10,000 new programmers in 3 years time then only 12,500 subsidized loans should be made available this year for that field. * Those who receive a subsidized loan should have a work requirement based on the value of the loan with a set percentage of your income from that work (say 50%) being contributed towards servicing the loan. The purpose of this is not to generate economic activity or to help make the credit facility cheaper, it restores the value information relationship between the student and their education. * Offer more generous tax based subsidies for those who offer apprenticeships * More aggressively advertise that there are very limited Ivy League advantages and they are generally not sufficient to justify the price tag. Do the same with Community College to Other school options, spending a year or two in a very inexpensive community college before transferring to another school for a final year (or two) has no impact on career attainment or pay, offers many more opportunities for scholarships and cuts the cost of education in half. * Make the last two years of high school optional. At 16 someone can transition in to a trade school or apprenticeship.

When he first got into office he had such high popularity that he got around half a dozen pieces of legislation right away with little republican resistance and later in the year passed about half a dozen pieces of legislation with their filibuster proof majorityinthe senate. They shut the Republicans completely out of the health care negotiations because they knew they didn't need any republican votes, they then passed it 60 to 0. Bush of course had congress (other than the filibusters) for about 5.6 years. Democrats of course controlled Congress for the two years before the financial crises. Bush did make a rather timid effort to reform the mortgage process well before the crisis, of course he found resistance from some Republicans and all democrats.

Many voters knowingly vote for corrupt people, and then when things go wrong they blame corporations, etc. when they knowingly played right into the corporations' hands, often helping to market that corrupt candidate for the whole election. I have a hard time taking complaints seriously from people like this. I'm not necessarily saying you're one of those people, but if you voted for Barack or Romney or promoted them, you are. Unfortunately, we both know nothing's going to change soon because people are easily controlled and effect of the media (one of the tools of those in power) isn't easy to overcome.

1	But but but how will you fight against tyranny without guns?	CheesewithWhine	politics	4	4	0	2014-04	1398265412	Thanks to our anti-gun culture which Americans like to mock, in the UK we've had less than 50 in the past 20 years. We average something like 2-3 people killed per year from police firearms. Over half of which happened in London. All of which get an inquest (external to the police via the IPCC) and many of which resulted in a closed trial (the names of the officers are not revealed unless found guilty of a crime). Then again our police are unique in the world due to fact that even armed police need special permission (from a senior officer) to deploy to a scene. No permission, no officers with guns allowed. Armed british officers also have some of the strictest training in the entire world, better or at least on par with most countries special police units (such as swat or anti-terrorism units). In 2011, the UK had 2 deaths by police firearms, 1 of which was a massive deal, sparked riots and a full on governmental investigation. 2 in the entire UK (65 million people) vs 20 in one small American city... Crazy.

Codetermination provides up to nearly half of the seats on the supervisory board to workers representatives. This is one of the reasons German companies are both efficient and generous to their employees at the same time. It's amazing how much better an operation works when the workers are treated as partners in the operation instead of replaceable cogs.

LionKatt	politics	7	7	0	2012-10	1350107349	Funny how many people don't know the simple facts of the candidates running in this election. I find it funny how many people don't know the facts of the candidates running in this election. I have heard twice today that Romney is a good christian, while Obama is a lying Muslim. Don't really care who people vote for (corporations win no matter which one gets in) but let's get facts straight. Romney is Mormon and Obama is a protestant, both christian religions (Mormons are Christian they believe in Jesus Christ) but Obama has more in common with the average american if u are talking religious beliefs. Also until 1978 Mormons didn't allow blacks in their church (very racist back then) and in 1978 Romney was 31 and part of that same church. Makes u wonder just what he was raised to think about other races. Hopefully he didn't believe everything his church preached.

This move is finally on par with the bait-and-switch issues the Republicans pull out every 2 years. Politics for the sake of winning is not admirable, but apparently it DOES work. It is an embarrassment to Democratic voters that Democratic leaders choose to believe the high-road will win in the end year after year. They're finally learning a valuable lesson that the GOP has known for years; your base will forgive you for nearly anything but if you want to win you need to go after the ridiculous voters as well.

Why doesn't the federal government want all the help it can get? They obviously need it, given the 13 million illegal aliens in this country, probably 4 million of which live in Arizona alone. So the question we really need to ask is: why doesn't the Obama administration want the states' help? It must want illegal aliens in this country against the will of the American people.

So, Mitt Romney is a Mormon, therefore he's an idiot. Ron Paul isn't *enough* of an evangelical brand Christian (anti-war, pro-marijuana, etc) and Newt Gingrich is just an asshole. Rick Santorum cares about the social issues that people in other parts of the country seem to have forgotten/come to terms with (abortion, gay marriage, family values), that evangelicals still hold dear.

My friend on facebook, who was my friend growing up, who never talked about politics growing up, and now only talks about politics on facebook has posted a link to a story about Obama laying off 100,000 members of the military. He made the comment ""President Obama to lay off 100,000 military personnel. Maybe they can collect unemployment. Seems that he prefers to pay people not to work."" My question is don't the taxpayers pay the members of the military's salary? And isn't unemployment paid buy the employer? So basically the tax payer. And am I right or wrong about unemployment being something you only get if you lose your job over something you have no control over? To me it seems like my friend is for tax dollars going to pay the military's salary, but not tax dollars going to pay for them being laid off. The way I understand it if say a person at a factory gets laid off then their employer who laid him/her off is paying for his unemployment, same with the military that his employer will be paying the unemployment, but his employer is funded by tax dollars.

In TRUE capitalism, businesses are not bailed out by the federal government. There is no such thing as ""too big to fail"". So, what is anti-capitalist about protesting the fact that large corporations were bailed out with your taxpayer money? I didn't see Main Street mom &amp; pop pizza joints get bailed out when they were going out of business, so why did Wall Street get bailed out when the CEOs of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs were taking multimillion dollar bonuses? Also, Mr. O'Reilly, you were hypercritical of the mainstream media for belitting the Tea Party and writing them off as racist/greedy/anarchists, so why are you writing off Occupy Wall Street as drugged up, lazy hippies? Lastly, remember that freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are two of the most important freedoms in the Bill of Rights. As Evelyn Beatrice Hall wrote (often misattributed to Voltaire): ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" So, in short, unless you have something constructive to add to the discussion, then please do us the favor of not saying anything at all. If you disagree with the premises, then that's great to debate and please contribute your viewpoint, but resorting to ad hominem attacks about the protesters is just bogus and is based on either pure partisanship, corruption or ignorance, and quite frankly, I'd say those 3 qualities are what have completely tanked our political system of late."

Up until that point, we should feel free to tax away, since certainly those assumptions are false in a sadly overwhelming majority of cases. It seems that people who subscribe to a very right-wing ideology seem to think that everything trickles down and produces more jobs, which would indeed boost the economy if that were the case. Unfortunately, I would argue that it isn't, and more good is done for the economy by taking that extra money that the rich would bank and giving it to people without enough money who would then need to spend it and put it back into the economy.

They shouldn't be treated equally. My point is they're all rich. I want people to understand that 100k per year is not middle class. It's rich. Not crazy rich. Not even *really* rich. It is, however, rich. The top 20% are the US rich and everyone in that category needs to admit it. The reason they don't want to admit it, is because they don't want to admit how much *worse* the majority of the country has it. No one wants to admit they're rich at 100k. Because it doesn't feel the way they expect rich to feel. They usually can't own a second house. If they have 2 or 3 kids they can't retire early. It doesn't *feel* rich, so they have a huge problem admitting it's rich. But it's rich. It's the top 20%. You're not middle class if you're not in the middle.

This law has done nothing but water down any patriotism that may have been attached to the pledge, and it's never going to change because what politician will say ""okay you can stop saying the pledge now"" What this law has done, is cut into valuable teaching time during my first period math class. This law has made me resent the pledges, especially the ""under God"" part (added to the Texas pledge in the last 10 years).

I don't live in one of those early caucus states but I can only imagine the ads are already constant. I do, however, already see them on youtube and plenty of other sites. Internet ads are really cheap and I'm sure a few million dollars goes a long way there. But I feel over the coming months a tsunami of TV and internet ads will flood all available commercial space and people will only turn to murderous rage against any candidate (Particularly since they will probably be 95% negative). I know some of you will say we've already had annoying amounts of election ads in previous cycles, but the near infinite money supply and short-sighted greed will blow those out of the water. And for my final water-based disaster metaphor, Citizens United will be the sirens that crash our politicians into angry, annoyed rocks.

This is simply a question based on wether or not liberal minds realize they're just as hypocritical and biased as their opposition.

Its the prime example of the saying ""When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail"". When your most highly funded area is the defense budget then the key to solving drugs and terrorism appears to be forcible regime changes and police state tactics. Apart from still having the death penalty the US's stance on drugs is the most primitive and backwards part of its justice system. Ridiculously harsh sentencing due to mandatory minimums, a system that targets minorities and a failure to distinguish between harmful drugs and marijuana are just some of the most fundamental issues.

A logic party. It seems like so many arguments thrown about in the media are very clearly flawed. How many times do debaters asign a stance to their opponent on then address is, or cherry pick a fact as evidence for a trend. These are clearly errors in logical thinking which can be addressed. I understand confirmation bias plays a role in that people reject facts in spite of logic to confirm their beliefs but that is not an absolute. By promoting logic and clear reasoning people are compelled to consider them. They may still ultimately come to the same conclusion but the more facts and reasoning they are forced to consider on making their decision the harder confirmation bias will be and their likelihood to reach a logical conclusion will increase. Many of us are shocked and appalled by the stupid, idiotic, and downright illogic beliefs of many of our fellow countrymen. Instead of lambasting their beliefs why not try and give them the tools to overcome their thinking. Logical thinking and a fact based approach to life is a learned skill and a philosophy. Instead of telling people why they are wrong why not try and give them the tools and skills to make decisions for themselves.

While people were fretting over the threat of another great war and a nuclear apocolypse, the Third World War was already being fought in a series of proxy wars, i.e Vietnam and Korea. The worst part of all of it though was the misunderstanding between cultures which caused it. Russia throughout history has withstood invasion from so many foreign peoples, steppe nomads at first and then the western nations, that they've developed such a hostile and defensive posture in regards to foreign interaction and are never willing to merely sit down and negotiate. Then along comes the Soviet Union, who from its inception is treated with outstanding hostility by the West as the French and British sent troops to support the White Army in the Russian Civil War. Then, all the way up until the second World War the mere existence of the Soviets was not even acknowledged by the Capitalist nations, who all feared Communist uprisings in their own countries. It was easy for Stalin to sign a non-aggression pact with Hitler because he was the only one who would even *talk* to him (never mind the whole enslave the Slavic population which Hitler clearly outlined in Mein Kampf, available in your nearest library). Shit goes down in Russia as the Nazis storm in, America sends them no help despite their pleas (they were a little occupied though, you have to give them that), and the greater part of Russia's youth is decimated. Therefore it is no wonder that the U.S.S.R was so hostile and distrusting of America, we gave them reason to be. All actions of the Russians during the Cold War were done in the mindset that *they* were the ones who would be attacked first, not us, the good ol' USA. (You know, I honestly don't remember what my original point was supposed to be, that was just kind of me going off on a tangent.)

1	You fucking commie!	getmarshall	politics	15	15	0	2012-03	1330925233	It really is amazing, actually. I consider myself a liberal in all senses of the word, and I don't think I'm a bad person. I think everyone in the US deserves a social safety net for the hard times. I think the poor need to be taken care of. I think people who love each other should be able to get married. I think we should have clean air, and water. I think current and future generations should be able to experience the natural treasures our country offers. I think kids should receive a quality education. I think what happens in your bedroom, between two consenting adults, is your business. I think employees should have fair, livable wages. Apparently these thoughts make me a bad person.

We should be so thankful we live in America. I am sure the increasing privatization of the system is only going to mean we maximize societal benefits of incarceration while not cutting back on any of the associated amenities. The whole point of the post was to draw attention to the fact that the US prison population is at unacceptable levels. That it mimics incarceration rates of a historical institution that clearly incarcerated in excess. Instead of being an apologist and looking for ways you can distinguish between a gulag and a prison (its honestly not that hard) you might want to seriously consider that maybe the US is doing something wrong.

Just like being the most powerful country in the world that can destroy all life on earth several times over is not a right, it is a tradition. Tradition makes neither of these things right. I didn't say that there was no room for cuts in the military budget did I? You just assumed that is what I meant.

There is a similar effect caused by the tug of the sun on the earth, though to a lesser extent. However, when the two forces line up, you get the spring tide (highest of the high tides) which occurs during the Full moon.
